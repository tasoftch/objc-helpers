// This category handles markers in strings. A marker is a string with this pattern: $(MARKER_NAME)
// It is recommended to unly use alpha-nummeric marker names.
// The resolution of a marker may contain other markers. To resolve them completely use the *Recursive* methods.

// Resolves one level markers. If a marker contains other markers, they will be igrored.

// Recursively resolution of markers. It will resolve each marker until its resolution does not produce more markers.
// The execution stops, if there is a recursion and a detailed error report is registered.
// If a recursion error occures, it stops the interpolation of further markers.
